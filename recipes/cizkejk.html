    <h1>Cheesecake</h1>
    <img src="../imgs/cheesecake.jpg" alt="TrileÃ§e, caramel soft cake served on the plate.">
    <p class="cake-desc">Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, layer
        consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and
        sugar. If there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or
        digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="wrap-recepie">
        <h4>For the crust</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>300g of plasma biscuits or gluten-free biscuits (for people on a gluten-free diet)</li>
            <li>5 spoons of milk</li>
            <li>180g of butter or margarine</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="wrap-recepie">
        <h4>For the cheesecake filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 piece of Ella cheese (450 g)</li>
            <li>1 cream fix</li>
            <li>1 vanilla sugar</li>
            <li>50ml of water</li>
            <li>1 gelatin (10 g)</li>
            <li>500ml of herbal cream (Meggle)</li>
            <li>220g of powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="wrap-recepie">
        <h4>For the fruit filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>450 g of red fruit (I used raspberries and blackberries)</li>
            <li>1 gelatin (10 g)</li>
            <li>50 ml of water for gelatin</li>
            <li>4 spoons of sugar</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <div class="wrap-recepie">
        <h4>Biscuit</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the fruit with water and sugar (about 10 min). Leave one gelatin to swell for 10 minutes. in water,
                melt it (it must not boil) and add it to the fruit that you took off the heat. Leave to cool.</li>
            <li>Melt margarine or butter and beat with a mixer with ground biscuits and milk. The mixture will be quite
                loose, so use your fingers or a rolling pin to press it into a round mold (diameter 26 cm).</li>
            <li>Leave to harden in the fridge while you whip the white filling.</li>
            <li>Whip the sweet cream and add the cream fix. Then add cheese, vanilla sugar and powdered sugar to that
                mixture. Leave the gelatin to swell for about 10 minutes. and then heat it just enough to melt (do not
                boil). Mix it with a little of this white mixture, then add it to the white filling and mix everything
                again. Press the white filling into the mold over the plasma. Be careful to fill the edges on the sides,
                so that you don't have holes when you remove the mold.</li>
            <li>When the red filling has cooled, spread it lightly over the white filling.</li>
            <li>Leave the cheesecake in the fridge to rest in the mold for 6 to 8 hours. Gently separate the cake from
                the mold with a knife and that's it... Your cheesecake is ready!</li>
